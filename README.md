# pure-esm-ts-template

Template with boilerplate for a pure ESM package in TypeScript; inspired by this [gist](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c).

## Overview

I made this template because I wanted a clean starting point for my TypeScript packages without bloated & unnessasary configurations.

#### CommonJS Support

The aim of this template is be to pure ESM. However, if you do need to support CommonJS you can use the example package file: `package.cjs.json`
